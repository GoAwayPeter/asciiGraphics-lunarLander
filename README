This project enables drawing of vector shapes on a terminal using the ncurses library. The interface is intended to be very simple to use, although it is not yet finished, and only supports drawing lines from a start point to end point, and some basic collision detection, but this was all that was required to create the lunarlander game.

To use the library, simply call the initVect(sizex,sizey) function, use the createLine(startX,startY,endX,endY) function to create a lineVector, and add it to the engine with the addLine(lineVector* line) function. Call draw() to draw the scene, and manipulate the lineVector with moveLine(lineVector* line, float x, float y) which moves the lineVector by the amount specified from the current position of the lineVector. The line can also be manipulated with rotateLine(lineVector* line, float degrees). 

Support for circles and rectangles is not yet supported.
